## Usage Description
### Farsi
When checked, English numbers will be converted to Farsi numbers.
When unchecked, English numbers will be converted to Arabic numbers.  

### Preserve Numbers
When checked numbers will not be converted.  

### Force Fix
RTL Text Mesh Pro does not fix texts that start with English characters. 
Checking this checkbox forces RTL TextMeshPro to fix the text even when it starts with English character. 
**Multiline English texts will have problem on components that have `ForceFix` checked.**  

### Fix Tags
When checked, RTL Text Mesh Pro will try to fix rich text tags.  

# Known Issues
* **Fixed in latest version. For older versions follow the steps below**
  We need to override the `text` property of `TextMeshProUGUI`. But the `text` property is not defined `virtual`. You need to manually make the property virtual.  
  * Open `TMP_Text.cs` from TextMeshPro source code
  * add virtual keyword to text property.  
  ![Text](Screenshots/TextProperty.PNG)
  * Open `RTLTextMeshPro.cs` and uncomment the top line where it says `//#define RTL_OVERRIDE`
  * Now you can use InputFields and Dropdowns.
